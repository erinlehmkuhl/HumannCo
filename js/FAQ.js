		{
			"question": "How much does a survey cost?",
			"answer": "The cost for most land surveying work is determined based on the following variables:<br><br>" +
				"<dfn>Record Search</dfn><br>" +
				"This varies by (a) the number of parcels involved; and (b) the number of past transactions. " +
				"(This necessary step is complicated by the casual manner in which land transactions have been handled in the past, " +
				"resulting in many vague, incomplete, and often contradictory legal descriptions and land records.)<br><br>" +

				"<dfn>Size and Shape of Property</dfn><br>" +
				"An irregularly shaped parcel has more corners to monument and a longer boundary than a rectangular parcel containing the same area.<br><br>" +

				"<dfn>Sectionalized Survey Work</dfn><br>" +
				"This could require the survey of the entire section (640 acres +) in which the land being surveyed lies, regardless of the area of the parcel. " +
				"In some cases a survey of more than one section is required, depending on the location of the parcel in question in relation to the sections " +
				"shown on the government plat map.<br><br>" +

				"<dfn>Terrain & Vegetation</dfn><br>" +
				"A level parcel of land is easier to survey than a mountainous parcel. Interference with lines of sight and " +
				"accessibility complicate field work.<br><br>" +

				"<dfn>Amount of Existing Evidence on the Property</dfn><br>" +
				"Existing evidence such as iron, wood, or stone monuments, old fences, and occupation lines, witness trees, etc., " +
				"aid the Surveyor. Their absence may compound difficulties involved in retracing boundaries."

		{
			"question": "What is an easement?",
			"answer": "An easement is an area of land owned by the property owner, but in which other parties, such as utility " +
			"companies, may have limited rights granted for a specific purpose. If a utility company owns the rights, they may " +
			"have a utility line running below the ground, across your property."
		},

		{
			"question": "What is an encroachment?",
			"answer": "Encroachments are improvements, such as fences or buildings, which extend across the property line."
		},
		{
			"question": "What is a plat?",
			"answer": "A legal document intended to take a large parcel of land and divide it into smaller parcels of land. " +
			"A subdivision plat may also create public rights-of-way or easements, and is usually filed with the county clerk " +
			"& recorder's office."
		},
		{
			"question": "How do I find my existing boundaries?",
			"answer": "You should have a description of your property included in your deed when you bought the property."
		},
		{
			"question": "What methods do surveyors use?",
			"answer": "Most Surveyors use electronic distance and angle measuring equipment, as well as the traditional " +
			"transit and tape. Modern computer systems aid in efficiently gathering measurements and in evaluating all " +
			"collected evidence required to perform the survey. Global Positioning Systems (G.P.S.) or 'satellite surveying' " +
			"can provide greater accuracy and efficiency for some surveys. Land Surveyors take pride in using instruments " +
			"and computers to perform land surveys efficiently, accurately, and cost effectively."
		},
		{
			"question": "How do I chose a land surveyor?",
			"answer": "Only a Professional Land Surveyor (or Civil Engineer registered prior to 1982) licensed by the State " +
			"Board for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors is legally authorized to practice land surveying in the State " +
			"of California. Most active Land Surveyors are listed in the yellow pages of the telephone directory, or a listing " +
			"may be obtained from the California Land Surveyors Association. A Land Surveyor is an integral part of a " +
			"professional team composed of attorneys, engineers, architects, planners, and landscape architects. <br><br> Some " +
			"land surveying firms offer comprehensive services including some, or all, of the above. Professional expertise can " +
			"have a significant impact upon the planned use of your property. Select a reputable Land Surveyor in whose skill and " +
			"judgment you can put your trust. Your selection should be made when you are sure that the professional you have " +
			"chosen has all of the facts, and is completely aware of your requirements and the requirements of the governmental " +
			"agency having jurisdiction over the property."

		{
			"question": "What kinds of surveys are there?",
			"answer": "There are many types of surveys including but not limited to:<br><br>" +
			"<dfn>ALTA/ACSM Survey or Extended Title Insurance Coverage Survey</dfn><br>" +
			"A survey made for the purpose of supplying a title company and lender with survey and location data" + 
			"necessary for issuing American Land Title Association or Extended Coverage Title Insurance.<br><br>" +

			"<dfn>Boundary Survey</dfn><br>" +
			"A survey for the purpose of locating the corners, boundary lines and/or easements of a given parcel of " +
			"land. This involves record and field research, measurements, and computations to establish boundary lines " +
			"in conformance with the Professional Land Surveyors Act.<br><br>" +

			"<dfn>Site Planning Survey</dfn><br>" +
			"A combination of boundary and topographic surveys for preparation of a site plan to be used for designing " +
			"improvements or developments.<br><br>" +

			"<dfn>Topographic Survey</dfn><br>" +
			"A survey locating topographic features - natural and man made - such as buildings, improvements, fences, " +
			"elevations, trees, streams, contours of the land, etc. This type of survey may be required by a governmental " +
			"agency, or may be used by engineers and/or architects for design of improvements or developments on a site.<br><br>" +

			"<dfn>Subdivision Survey</dfn><br>" +
			"The subdivision of a tract of land into smaller parcels, showing monumentation and survey data on a map, " +
			"in conformance with local ordinances and the Subdivision Map Act.<br><br>" +

			"<dfn>Control Survey</dfn><br>" +
			"Precise location of horizontal and vertical positions of points for use in boundary determination, mapping " +
			"from aerial photographs, construction staking, and other related purposes.<br><br>" +

			"<dfn>Construction Survey</dfn><br>" +
			"Construction staking to establish the correct location of structures shown on improvement plans for constructing " +
			"roads, pipelines, building, etc."
		},
		{
			"question": "Will a Land Surveyor tell me what I own?",
			"answer": "No. It is your responsibility to furnish the Surveyor with a legal description, current title report, " +
			"or policy concerning the parcel that you want surveyed. The Surveyor will then locate the property on the ground, " +
			"and provide you with a record of survey map showing the results of the survey."
		},
		{
			"question": "Will I be shown if there are any encroachments on the property?",
			"answer": "Yes, if you instruct the Land Surveyor to show encroachments in the area of concern to you."
		},
		{
			"question": "Will I be shown if there are any easements on my property?",
			"answer": "Yes, if you instruct the Surveyor to do so, and provide a current title report or title policy to use for this " +
			"purpose. The Surveyor will supply a map, plat, or exhibit showing this information."
		},
		{
			"question": "How will I be shown what has been surveyed?",
			"answer": "Corners of the property will be marked with stakes, pipes, or other such monuments with the Professional Land " +
			"Surveyor's license number indicated thereon. The corners on the parcel will be pointed out to you, if requested. " +
			"A record of survey or corner record will be filed when these monuments are set, indicating dimensions of property " +
			"lines, monuments, and other relative data as required by the Land Surveyors Act, the client, or others."
		},
		{
			"question": "Why are there conflicting boundary and easement lines?",
			"answer": "It is often true that boundary disputes and overlaps are a result of legal descriptions which were originally " +
			"written and recorded without the benefit of the services of a Professional Land Surveyor. It is important to have " +
			"these lines properly described and surveyed, if necessary, when property or easement lines are created or changed."
